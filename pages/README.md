# Pages Directory

Nuxt provides a file-based routing to create routes within your web application using Vue Router under the hood.

This directory is optional, meaning that `vue-router` won't be included if you only use app.vue (unless you set `pages:
true` in `nuxt.config` or have a `app/router.options.ts`), reducing your application's bundle size.
